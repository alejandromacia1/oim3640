# Learning Log - Session 1

## What I worked on during the class
During this first session of the semester, I reflected on a repetitive task that I conduct every day that I believe could improve my performance. I tend to struggle with organization and time management, considering that new scenarios and events are constantly being added to my schedule on a regular basis. I believe that this is an issue that a lot of my friends and close family members also encounter. 

## Creating the Prototype App
My proposal is to build an app that functions as an intelligent personal assistant and that is able to not only send real-time reminds about upcoming events in your day, but also adjust your daily schedule based on new inputs or delays with meetings. This will allow users to reprioritize tasks automatically and improve their productivity throughout the day.
