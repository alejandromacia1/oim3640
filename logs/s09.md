## What I learned today
During todays class, we learned about the while loop, which keeps going until a condition becomes False. The key difference between the for and while is that for loop iterates over a known sequence and the while loop keeps going until a condition changes. The rule of thumb for these loops is that: if you know the count, use for, but if you're waiting for a condition, use while. Furthermore, we learned about the break statement, which helps us exit the loop immediately. The continue statement skips to the next iteration. The in operator checks if a character is in a string: 'e' in 'Gadsby' (Answer: False). Finally, we learned about the search patterns and how to create a function that checks if a word contains any of the letters that are given from a set of letters. For linear searches, return True early if found, and return False at the end (not indented).

## Code/work I'm proud of
There are two codes that I am proud of. The first one being: 

"""
def evaluate_score(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "Excellent work! You scored an A"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "Congratulations! You passed the exam."
    else:
        return "Unfortunately, you did not pass. Better luck next time"
"""

And the second one being: 

"""
def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    return False

print(is_leap_year(2026))
print(is_leap_year(2024))
print(is_leap_year(2028))
"""

## Challenges I faced
The main challenge I faced during the class was keeping up with the pace of Professor Li. I felt that he was explaining some of the new concepts very fast, so it was very difficult for me to fully understand everything he was including in the lines of code. Furthermore, I had a hard time understanding how the while loops work. I was able to later understand that while loops help repeat a block of code if the condition is true. This means that it keeps running until the condition is False. It is best to use these loops when we don’t know the amount of times a process should repeat, or when we want something to change, so we make it run until it does. 


## AI usage
During this session, I turned on my AI agent to create a function that incorporated the "while" command. I asked it to create a function that would allow me to determine whether students in the class arrived on time or late to our class, which starts at 9:45am. I will be attaching the code that the AI agent generated for me, which was pretty accurate and useful. 

"""
 arrival_time = ""
 while arrival_time != "quit":
    arrival_time = input("Enter your arrival time (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    if arrival_time != "quit":
        print(f"You arrived at: {arrival_time}")
        if arrival_time < "09:45":
            print("You are early!")
        elif arrival_time == "09:45":
            print("You are on time!")
        else:
            print("You are late!")
