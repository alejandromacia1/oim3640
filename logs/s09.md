# Session #9 - 2 / 19

## What I learned today


## Code/work I'm proud of
There are two codes that I am proud of. The first one being: 

"""
def evaluate_score(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "Excellent work! You scored an A"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "Congratulations! You passed the exam."
    else:
        return "Unfortunately, you did not pass. Better luck next time"
"""

And the second one being: 

"""
def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    return False

print(is_leap_year(2026))
print(is_leap_year(2024))
print(is_leap_year(2028))
"""

## Challenges I faced


## AI usage
During this session, I turned on my AI agent to create a function that incorporated the "while" command. I asked it to create a function that would allow me to determine whether students in the class arrived on time or late to our class, which starts at 9:45am. I will be attaching the code that the AI agent generated for me, which was pretty accurate and useful. 

"""
 arrival_time = ""
 while arrival_time != "quit":
    arrival_time = input("Enter your arrival time (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    if arrival_time != "quit":
        print(f"You arrived at: {arrival_time}")
        if arrival_time < "09:45":
            print("You are early!")
        elif arrival_time == "09:45":
            print("You are on time!")
        else:
            print("You are late!")
