## What I learned today
Today we focused on learning for loops. We reviewed the difference of print and return: if function doesn't explicitly return any values, it will return none. Furthermore, we learned about a community of beginner users in Reddit that answer questions about lines of codes and commands (the name of the online community is r/learnpython). As a person who has no experience in python before enrolling in this class, I consider this tool to be very helpful as it is an alternative that might be useful in the future when reviewing for quizzes or mini-quizzes. During the last 30 minutes of class, we learned how to draw different shapes, including pyramids and squares with # values. These exercises helped me to better understand how small changes in code can affect the final output and how for loops control repetition. 

## Code/work I'm proud of

"""
#draw a pyramid
    #         4 spaces + 1 # i = 0 
   ###        3 spaces + 3 #
  #####       2 spaces + 5 # 
 #######      1 spaces + 7 #

def draw_pyramid(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(' '*(n-i-1) + '#'*(i*2+1))

draw_pyramid(4)
"""

## Challenges I faced
The main challenge I faced during today's session was when I was trying to code the final print line for the last pyramid shape, which Professor Li recommended us to try on our own. I struggled to understand the logic behind how the spaces and the # symbols work together, particularly because this final shape did not start at the beginning of the line but instead had the # values were centered. At first, it was difficult for me to understand the relationships between the expressions (' '*(n-i-1) and '#'*(i*2+1)) control both the width and the alignment of each row in a figure. 

## AI usage
When we began learning how to code shapes (squares), I initially turned on and kept using my AI assistance because I didn’t feel completely comfortable working through the logic on my own yet. I felt that this tool allowed me to stay at the same pace as Professor Li. Nonetheless, I decided to turn it off for the final two exercises, in which we were asked to create a function that would display two different pyramid styles, in an effort to practice more independently and better comprehend the process and logic behind these functions. By doing this, I was able to build more confidence in writing the code and apply the concepts we had previously learned throughout the session.
