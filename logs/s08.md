## What I learned today
During this class, we learned an interesting fun fact regarding the origin of the name 'Python' for the programming language, which came from Guido's van Rossum's favorite comedy TV show. Furthermore, we covered boolean expressions, which are expressions that evaluate either to True or False. Some of the examples we reviewed were: x = 5, x == 5 (Answer: True, refers to equality), x != 3 (Answer: False, refers to not equal), x > 10 (Answer: False, refers to greater than) and x >= 5 (Answer: True, refers to greater than or equal). We also learned that logical operators combine conditions. In that case, if: age = 25, age >= 18 and age < 65 (Answer: True, applies if age is greater or equal and if age is less than 65), age < 18 or age >= 65 (Answer: False, applies if age is less than 18 or if age is greater or equal than 65). Finally, we learned about conditional statements. Some key points to remember are that order matter, meaning that the first matching condition wins, elif and else statements are optional, and each branch must be indented.

## Challenges I faced
The main challenge I encountered during class was understanding the difference between the if, elif, and else statements. At the beginning it was confusing for me to determine when each of the statements should be used. However, as Professor Li gave us examples to practice with, I began to understand that the if statement checks the first condition (which means that the statement should start with this one); the elif and else statements help us check the conditions if the previous ones do not apply (if the if statement is False).
