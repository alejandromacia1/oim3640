# Session #5 - 2 / 3

## What I learned today
During today's session, I reviewed how to open Jupyter Lab notebooks using Github Desktop and Command Prompt. Furthermore, I learned about the differences between int and float; integers represent numbers with no fractional or decimal part, while floating-point numbers represent integers or numbers with decimal parts. On the other hand, I learned about the purpose of % (also referred to as: remainder operator, which gives you the remainder of a division. For example: 17 % 5 will give you a result of 2. I thought that the application and existence of this operator was very interesting. I was also able to learn about the difference between an expression and a statement; a statement performs an action, and prints a result, while an expression produces a value. 

## Code/work I'm proud of
The code I am most proud of from today's session is the last exercise we conducted in class. I believe that this code was very appealing to me, as it allowed me to interact with it in the terminal section. As one starts running the code, it requires you to input the value of the item you are dealing with, for it to later tell you the total tax amount that you would be required to pay. 

# computer_price = float(input('Enter the product price:'))
# iphone_price = 1100
# mass_rate = 0.0625
# ny_rate = 0.08875
# tax_computer = calc_tax(computer_price, mass_rate)
# tax_iphone = calc_tax(iphone_price, ny_rate)


# total_tax = tax_computer + tax_iphone
# print(total_tax)

## Challenges I faced
I would say that the only challenge I faced during this class was keeping up with the pace of professor Li. At the beginning of the course, I was able to follow his rhythm, but around the midpoint of the class I began to fall behind. I believe that this happened because he was providing us with a lot of information and explanations at the same time, so his speed naturally increased. Considering that I have no prior experience with the platforms and the applications being utilized in the course, I tend to make sure that I am writing all the codes well. Hence, I usually take more time than usual to double check all the lines of code before running the code to avoid any syntax errors. As professor Li is way more familiar with Python than me, he tends to code at a faster rate, which puts me at a disadvantage regarding time management. 

## AI usage
During this session, I was able to activate the AI agent in the VSCode platform. Although I didn’t use it as much, considering that I want to be able to understand how to create all the lines of code by myself, I thought it was very useful how the agent is able to predict the rest of the line of code you are currently working in. For beginners like me, this feature is very appealing, as it allows me to understand the nature behind the lines of code and helps me familiarize with all the function names and the structure of the program.
