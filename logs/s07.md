## What I learned today
Today during class, we downloaded a new library called "turtle", which allows us to draw different shapes and graphics. I learned about the basic turtle commands, such as forward(d) and backward(d), which make pixels move either forward or backward. Additionally, we learned about left(angle) and right(angle) commands, which help turn the angle to the right or to the left. We initially learned how to draw simple geometric shapes, such as a square, but then combined those commands with the for loops functions we had learned from previous chapters. Hence, we were able to incorporate parameters to the function so we play with the size length of the square we wanted to draw. Furthermore, one of the most complex functions we covered during the class today was one that allowed us to draw a polygon of n sides. This session allowed me to better understand the value that docstrings have, considering that they allow us to comprehend what is the function trying to accomplish, especially when more than one parameter is included. 

## Code/work I'm proud of
""" 
def draw_spiral(t):
    """
    Draw one square, turn an angle, then draw another square and so on
    """
    for i in range(36):
        draw_square(t, 50 + i * 2)
        t.left(10)
"""

## Challenges I faced
I would say that the main challenge I faced during class today was managing my time during the quiz. I found it difficult because the format was unfamiliar to me, considering that in class we usually learn to code on a computer, but the quiz was completed by hand. Despite this, I believe that I performed well on it. Now, for future occasions, I feel that I now have a better understanding of the format and will be more prepared for them. I will continue to study hard and maintain a strong performance throughout the semester. 

## AI usage
During this session, I did not utilize any AI related tools. 

## Questions for next time
The only line of code I didn't understand during the content covered in todays session was the following: 

"""
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""
