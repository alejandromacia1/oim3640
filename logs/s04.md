## What I learned today
During class, we held a discussion regarding the differences between programming languages and the English language; natural languages are the languages that us humans speak, such as Spanish, English, and Portuguese. On the other hand, there are formal languages, which are languages that are designed for specific purposes and applications across distinct fields. Some of the differences between formal and natural languages rely on the fact that natural languages hold ambiguity, whereas formal languages are designed to be unambiguous. This means that, regardless of the context, a word has an exact meaning in a program. In natural languages, different words and different sentences might allude to different things, or can be used across distinct scenarios. Another characteristic that sets apart natural languages from formal languages is redundancy, considering that natural languages use redundancy while formal languages are more concise. 

## Code/work I'm proud of
Some of the work I am proud of refers to the fact that I was able to work on the first chapter of the Jupyter Lab notebooks. As I completed the readings of the chapter beforehand, I was able to quickly apply my previous knowledge and start filling out the initial chapter of the digital notebook. 

## Challenges I faced
Halfway during the class, I was experiencing some issues while operating the CommandPrompt platform. Hence, I asked professor Li for help, and he determined that I had made an issue during the installation of the Anaconda Navigator application. Hence, he recommended that I uninstall the app and download it again to effectively tackle the issue. Other than that, I did not experience any issues. I was able to take notes throughout the session and everything else ran smoothly. 

## AI usage
During this session, I did not use any AI for coding. Nonetheless, I did experience an issue while running a code. 

## Questions for next time
After Professor Li recommended that I uninstall Anaconda Navigator to fix the technical issue I was encountering, I was unable to do so. Hence, for the next class I will try to arrive a couple of minutes early to class so that I can seek help from him and attempt to resolve it. Regarding the material covered during the class session, the only thing that remains a bit unclear is the way in which strings and variables work. When attributing a name to a value, I have to remember that variables are case-sensitive. I will try to review the content of this session and independently try to improve on this.
