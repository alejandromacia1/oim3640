# Notes for Chapter 1: 
## Arithmetic Computators: 
- Symbols that represent arithmetic computations.
- Plus sign: Performs addition. 
- Minus sign: Performs subtraction. 
- Asterisk: Performs multiplication. 
- Forward slash: Performs division.
- Double asterisk: Performs exponentiation.  

- Integers: Represent numbers with no fractional or decimal part. 
- Floating-point numbers: Represent integers and numbers with a decimal point.

If you add, subtract, or multiply two integers, the result will be an integer. But if you divide two integers the result will be a floating-point number. Hence, there is an operator called the integer division which is represented by //. The result of the integer division is always an integer. 

Integer division is also called floow division because it always rounds down. 

## Expressions: 
- A collection of operators. 
Python follows PEMDAS, when dealing with expressions. 

## Arithmetic Functions: 
- Round: Takes a floating-point number and rounds if off to the nearest integer. 
- Abs: Computes the absolute value of a number. Positive value will be the number itself but for negative values the result will be the positive value of itself. 
- When using a function, we say that we are calling a function. An expression that calls a function is a function call. 

- Syntax Error: Means that there is something wrong with the structure of the expression. 

## Strings: 
- Sequences of letters. 
'Hello' straight or double quotation marks. 
- Double quotes make it easy to write a string that contains an apostrophe, which is the same symbol as a straight quote. 

- The plus operator works with strings as it joins two strings into a single string, this is called a concatenation. 

- The asterisk operator also works with strings. It multiplies copies of a string and concatenates them. 

len ('  ') = Computes the length of a string. Counts the letters between the quotes but not the quotes. 

Using back quotes create syntax error. 

## Values and Types: 
Every value has a type, belongs to a type. 
- Function type (X) and it tells you what type it is. 
int = integer, str = string, float = floating-point number.

Numbers inside quotations = String. 

Type Error =  The values in the expression, which are called operands, have the wrong type. 

1,000,000 = 1_000_000 for python to read. 

## Formal and Natural Languages: 
- Natural languages are the languages people speak, like English and Spanish. They were not designed by people but rather evolved naturally.
- Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. 

Things in Common that are Differences:
- Ambiguity: Natural languages have ambiguity. Formal languages are completely unambiguous. 
- Redundancy: Formal languages are less redundant and more concise. Natural languages use redundancy. 
- Literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphors while formal languages mean exactly what they say. 

## Debugging: 
- Bugs: Programming errors
- Debugging: Process of tracking them down. 


# Chapter 2 Notes: 

## Variables: 
- A variable is a name that refers to a value. 
To create a variable we can write a assignment statement. 
An assignment statement has three parts: the variable on the left, the equals operator, and an expression to the right. 
(Expression can be an integer, floating-point number or a string)

When running an assignment statement, there is no output. Hence, Python creates the variable and gives it a value but the assignment statement has no visible effect.

## State Diagrams
A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to its value. This is a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in. 

## Variable Names
- Variables can contain both numbers and letters, but they can't begin with a number. 

Only punctuation that can appear in a variable name is an underscore. Using another character will result in a syntax error. 

## Import Statement:

You have to import some Python features to be able to use them, such as math module. 

A module is a collection of variables and functions. To use a variable in a module, you have to use the dot operator (.) between the name of the module and the name of the variable.

sqrt = square root (math.sqrt(25))
pow = raises one number to the power of a second number (math.pow(5, 2))

## Expressions and Statements:

An expression can be a single value, like an integer, floating-point number, or string. It can also be a collection of values and operators. And it can include variable names and function calls.

- A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, but no value. 

Evaluation: Computing the value of an expression.

Execution: Running a statement. 

## Print Function: 

If you evaluate more than one expression, only the value of the last one is displayed.

To display more than one value, you can use the print function (works also with strings and floating-point numbers)

## Arguments:

When you call a function, the expression in parenthesis is called an argument.
- Some functions only take one argument while others take two. 

## Comments: 

As formal languages are dense and programs become more complicated. It is easier to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. 
These notes are called comments, and they start with the # symbol.

Everything after the # is not added into the execution of the program. 

Useful when contains information that is not included in the code. 

## Debugging: 
- Syntax error: “Syntax” refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python does not run the program. It displays an error message immediately.

- Runtime error: If there are no syntax errors in your program, it can start running. But if something goes wrong, Python displays an error message and stops. This type of error is called a runtime error. Indicates that something exceptional has happened. 

-  Semantic error: The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it runs without generating error messages, but it does not do what you intended. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing. (Formatting error but code still runs)
