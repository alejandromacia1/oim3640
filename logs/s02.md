# Learning Log - Session 2 

## What we reviewed and learned during class: 
- During this class, we reviewed the basics about the different programs we will be using throughout the semester, such as VsCode and Github. Furthermore, we learned how to download extensions in VsCode and how to commit and push our repo to Github. 

- Additionally, I took a brief look at my prototype app idea, which I believe could be useful to many individuals, as the main focus of the application would be to improve individual’s time management and productivity throughout the day. I will continue to think about this idea during the upcoming classes to see if I can work on developing this idea later during the semester. 

As for the in-class assignment, we setted up the course repository in VSCode and then uploaded it to Github. We were required to submit our Github  repo link for Professor Li to have access to our progress and monitor our work throughout the semester.
